@W: FX474 |User-specified initial value defined for some sequential elements which can prevent optimum synthesis results from being achieved. 
@W: MT529 :"d:\clases\arqui\oscvhdl\div00.vhdl":20:1:20:2|Found inferred clock oscint00|osc_int_inferred_clock which controls 23 sequential elements including K00.OS01.sdiv[21:0]. This clock has no specified timing constraint which may prevent conversion of gated or generated clocks and may adversely impact design performance.
